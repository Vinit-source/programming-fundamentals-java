## HOTS Questions

1.  Write a Java program that reads a year from the user. The program should determine whether the year is a leap year or not. A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00). The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400.
    
2.  Write a Java program that reads three integers from the user representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The program should determine the type of the triangle based on the lengths of its sides (equilateral, isosceles, or scalene). An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal. An isosceles triangle is a triangle in which two sides are equal. A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.
    
3.  Write a Java program that reads a month (1-12) and day (1-31) from the user. Use nested `if-else` statements or `switch` statements to determine the season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) of the provided date. You may assume that the day of the month is valid for the given month.
