### Day 1: Environment setup

In the initial phase of learning Java, the first step is setting up your environment for Java development. This includes installing the Java Development Kit (JDK) and a Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) on your machine.

**Java Development Kit (JDK):** The JDK includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed in Java development. Download and install the JDK appropriate for your operating system from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17).

**Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** IDEs make it easier to write and debug code. Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA are two of the most popular Java IDEs. You can download Eclipse from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or IntelliJ IDEA from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

**Hello World:** After setting up the JDK and an IDE, write a simple "Hello, World!" program to verify that your setup works correctly. Here's a sample "Hello, World!" program:


```
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
``` 

You can run this program in your IDE to check if your environment is set up correctly. If the program runs and prints "Hello, World!" to the console, your Java development environment is set up and ready to go!
