1. Write a Java program that takes the height of the pyramid as the input and generates a pyramid of the inputted height.
```
Enter the height of the pyramid: 5
        * 
      * * * 
    * * * * * 
  * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * *
```
2. How would you modify the pyramid pattern program to generate an inverted pyramid?
3. How could you optimize the program to reduce the number of loop iterations?
